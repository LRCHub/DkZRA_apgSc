Cars are passing days and night
To where the land finished

And it's my twenty-ninth replay
Of ours embraces

I'm moving - opening new doors
With the keys of your kingdom
I look in the mirror and i say

'I kill myself if i ever went blind
I kill myself if i ever went blind'

Youth is in you like a gift
You're spending your days
Walking by the seaside
